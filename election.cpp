/*
I. Winner of the election

Develop a C++ program to read election data from a file and compute the results. The file contains
candidate names and their vote counts. The program must calculate the total number of votes,
compute the vote percentage for each candidate, determine the winner(s), and output both the
results and any tie information to the screen and a file.
The solution must:
• Use manual sorting.
• Avoid advanced C++ features like vector, cerr, ostream, and stream manipulators (<<).
• Use basic arrays, printf(), fprintf(), and fgets() for input/output.

See PDF for sample input/output

- The data is read from candidates.txt file
- A part of data is printed on console and other part is written to a file


Note:
- Program must be written in C++ and must use a class
- Use \t when displaying candidate name, vote received and percentage
